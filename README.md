<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">âœ¨ I spent a few weekends learning basic programming languages at a high level (via executive education courses) such as Python so I can collaborate even more effectively with data scientists in building data and analytics products. <br><br>When I worked in a start-up without the luxury of in-house analyst and data science resources, Python was useful in normalising and analysing platform usage trends to identify opportunities to improve performance against success metrics.<br><br>ðŸ“š I'm currently learning about Generative AI for product applications. <br><br>ðŸŽ² Fun fact: I enjoy exploring data visualisation tools in my free time and built a trade flow tool on Tableau over a weekend to help a friend identify and prioritise sales opportunities.</p>
